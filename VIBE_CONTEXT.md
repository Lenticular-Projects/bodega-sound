# Vibe Base Context

This project uses the **Foundational Architecture** ("Vibe Base").

## Key Principles
1. **Design First**: We do not ship ugly software. Transitions, spacing, and typography matter.
2. **AI Native**: Intelligence is not an add-on; it is core to the functionality.
3. **Simplicity**: Do not over-engineer. Use standard `cn` utilities, `framer-motion` for interactions, and `@carbon/icons-react` for icons.

## Global Context
- **Theme**: Light Mode by default.
- **Font**: Geist Sans / Geist Mono.
- **Stack**: Next.js 16 App Router.

Use the `rules.md` file for strict coding standards.
